# MovieRatings
Predicting what a movie will be rated on IMDb based on its characteristics

### Goal
We will be using various prediction algorithms( Random Forest, Adaboost, etc) to predict the rating and revenue of a movie. We will use characteristics such as the year released, budget, and genre to predict those values.


### Current Progress
Currently, we are cleaning the data and putting into a format that is more useful for machine learning.


Note: Not all files from our local lib folders could be pushed to Github because of size restrictions
